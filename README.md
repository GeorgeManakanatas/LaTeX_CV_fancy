# LaTeX_CV_fancy

My current CV, based on the [Extended Fancy CV](https://www.sharelatex.com/templates/cv-or-resume/extended-fancy-cv-(carmine-benedetto)) LaTeX template by Carmine Benedetto.

## Quick Start

The template should be in [**sharelatex.com**](https://www.sharelatex.com/templates/cv-or-resume/extended-fancy-cv-(carmine-benedetto)) and can be used as a starting point.

## How to use
### Requirements

A full TeX distribution is assumed.  [Various distributions for different operating systems (Windows, Mac, \*nix) are available](http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/55437) but TeX Live is recommended. Install as appropriate for your OS.

### Usage

At a command prompt, run
```
$ xelatex {my-cv-name}.tex
```
This should create a ``{your-cv-name}.pdf`` file.
